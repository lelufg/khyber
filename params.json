Also I would like to say this is going to be updated weekly, as well as my work on LeprechaunProject. Oh, don't know what it is? Checkout [here!](https://github.com/lelufg/shelleprechaun/)\r\n\r\n ## where is the linux version, dickhead? ##\r\n**Why such aggressive? :(**\r\nLinux version will be added later, there is some stuff i need to change before release it, otherwise it will bug all over your desktop. You wouldn't like if this happen, right? \r\n\r\n## what language? ##\r\nWell, for Windows there is BATCH, and for Linux (in a proper future) there is SHELL. Dunno if i'll add some ports for Python or Cpp, who knows :p\r\n\r\n## can i share or edit? ##\r\nSure but keep in mind that is my work and I've done this by myself. Put some credits at the end and everything will be fine.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
